## About
**ChronoPy** is a lightweight Python class designed to help developers measure the execution time of their code. Whether you're benchmarking a function or tracking the performance of a script, **ChronoPy** makes it easy to get precise timing results in a human-readable format (`hh:mm:ss:ms`).

---

## Features
- üïí Measure time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- üöÄ Simple and intuitive API.
- üìä Perfect for benchmarking and performance tracking.
- üíª Compatible with Python 3.x.

---

## Installation
To use **ChronoPy**, simply clone this repository or copy the `Chrono` class into your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DRAGON154A/ChronoPy.git
cd ChronoPy
```


---

## Usage
1. Import the `Chrono` class into your Python script.
2. Create an instance of the `Chrono` class.
3. Use the `start()` method to begin timing.
4. Use the `end()` method to stop timing and display the results.

---

## Example
Here's a quick example to demonstrate how **ChronoPy** works:

```python
from chrono import Chrono
import time

# Create a Chrono instance
timer = Chrono()

# Start the timer
timer.start()

# Simulate a task (e.g., sleep for 2.5 seconds)
time.sleep(2.5)

# Stop the timer and display the results
timer.end()
```

### Output:
```
00:00:02:500
```
